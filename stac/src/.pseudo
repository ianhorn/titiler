How to create a stac item with a thumbnail using Titiler running
on a local docker container.

import modules:
    requests
    json
    constants

create functions:
    1. Get Bounds = titiler/bounds from url
        return list as a variable
    2. create stac item properties from constants and bounds
            datetime, assets (thumbnail from get bounds), with projection, raster, maybe eo
    3. POST stac item to API

Process on 1 file, then set up for multiprocessing
